MENACE implemented in Hexapawn using python 3.8

Made it for a high school class' research project.
knew nothing about MENACE and Hexapawn before until my friend told me about it. And thought that it was similar to a ML Algorithm and found it interesting.
The class was about doing research in general, so I used the occasion to learn about it as an intro to Machine Learning.
